#  WKWebView content inset bugs

- WebKit Bug Report - https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182710

When a WKWebView's scrollView's contentInsets are adjusted automatically, which is the default behavior on iOS 11, scrolling from the DOM using `window.scrollTo()` doesn't work correctly. A call `window.scrollTo(0, 0)` will not scroll the page all the way to the top, but leaves part of the content sitting beneath the navigation bar. When the `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior = .never` and the contentInsets are set manually, it scrolls to the correct position.This issue is present when the web view sits beneath the nav bar/tab bar, but not otherwise. The included sample project demonstrates the bug and the correct behavior.

**Update:**: this seems to have been fixed in iOS 11.3. However, the bug appears again in iOS 12 in a different way.

On the left, you can see the broken behavior after scrolling all the way to the top. On the right, you can see where it should have scrolled:
